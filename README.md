# Welcome to my Github!
    I was (and am) the nerdy sister in the family. I was enthralled by science and all things technical since I was a kid. 
    Scaled drawings of my bedroom and furniture, mastering Quicken even before I had any money, playing and fiddling with 
    old retired laptops my dad brought home from work and my toy microscope were some of my favorite pastimes. 

    After earning my B.S. and teaching middle school science I finally realized that my true passion and talent lies in the
    technical world. I completed a full stack boot camp and haven't stopped coding since.  

    Thanks for stopping by!
